Recommendation System Overview

A recommendation system is a type of information filtering technology that suggests items to users based on their past behavior, preferences, or interests. There are several techniques to build a recommendation system, including collaborative filtering and content-based filtering. In this response, I will outline a simple recommendation system using both techniques.

Collaborative Filtering (CF)

Collaborative filtering is a technique that recommends items to users based on the behavior or preferences of similar users. The underlying assumption is that if users A and B have similar preferences, they will likely have similar opinions on items they haven't rated yet.
Here's a high-level overview of a simple CF-based recommendation system:

User-Item Matrix

| User ID | Item 1 | Item 2 | ... | Item N | | --- | --- | --- | ... | --- | | 1 | 5 | 3 | ... | 4 | | 2 | 4 | 5 | ... | 3 | | ... | ... | ... | ... | ... | | M | 2 | 4 | ... | 5 |

In this matrix, each row represents a user, and each column represents an item. The cell values represent the user's rating for the item (e.g., 1-5).

Similarity Calculation

To recommend items to a user, we need to find similar users. We can calculate the similarity between users using various metrics, such as:
Cosine Similarity: measures the cosine of the angle between two vectors
Jaccard Similarity: measures the similarity between two sets
Pearson Correlation: measures the linear correlation between two variables
Recommendation Generation

Once we have the similarity matrix, we can generate recommendations for a user by:

Finding the top N similar users
Calculating the weighted average of their ratings for each item
Ranking the items by their weighted average rating

Content-Based Filtering (CBF)

Content-based filtering recommends items to users based on the features or attributes of the items themselves. The underlying assumption is that if a user likes an item with certain features, they will likely like other items with similar features.

Here's a high-level overview of a simple CBF-based recommendation system:

Item Features

| Item ID | Feature 1 | Feature 2 | ... | Feature N | | --- | --- | --- | ... | --- | | 1 | Action | Comedy | ... | 1995 | | 2 | Romance | Drama | ... | 2010 | | ... | ... | ... | ... | ... | | N | Thriller | Horror | ... | 2005 |

User Profile

We can create a user profile by extracting the features from the items they have rated or interacted with.

Recommendation Generation

To recommend items to a user, we can:

Calculate the similarity between the user profile and each item feature vector
Rank the items by their similarity score
Hybrid Approach

We can also combine both CF and CBF techniques to create a hybrid recommendation system. This approach can leverage the strengths of both techniques to provide more accurate and personalized recommendations.




Simple Recommendation System
===========================

This repository provides a simple implementation of a recommendation system using collaborative filtering and content-based filtering.

**Collaborative Filtering**

The collaborative filtering model recommends items to users based on the behavior or preferences of similar users.

**Content-Based Filtering**

The content-based filtering model recommends items to users based on the features or attributes of the items themselves.

**Hybrid Model**

The hybrid model combines both collaborative filtering and content-based filtering to provide more accurate and personalized recommendations.

**Usage**

1. Load the user-item matrix and item features using the `data_loader` module.
2. Create an instance of the `CollaborativeFiltering`, `ContentBasedFiltering`, or `HybridModel` class.
3. Call the `recommend` method to generate recommendations for a user.

**Evaluation Metrics**

The `evaluation_metrics` module provides functions to calculate precision and recall for evaluating the performance of the recommendation system.

**Requirements**

* Python 3.7+
* pandas
* scikit-learn
